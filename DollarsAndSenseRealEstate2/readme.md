The website that I created is for a fake real estate company.  I decided to do 5 different pages that will showcase different features using the CSS and JAVA technologies.

CSS Features

​	I created a navigation menu  that collapses down as the page get smaller.  When I get to a certain small size, which is for mobile, the menu will transform into a hamburger button to control the menu navigatyion.

​	The elements within the website are set up with Flexboxes that will wrap text and images as the screen size is manipulated.
